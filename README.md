 ## Tutorial
 [![Tutorial](https://github.com/numediart/ValidEEG/blob/main/tutorial.jpg?raw=true)](https://youtu.be/8VjubupsB9Q)

 
 ## Requirements
 * MATLAB 2016+
 * [FieldTrip Toolbox](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download.php)
 * [SEREEGA Toolbox](https://github.com/lrkrol/SEREEGA)
 
 ## Benchmark (plug and play)
 1. Clone this github repository : `git clone https://github.com/LucaLaFisca/Validation-Framework-Source-Reconstruction.git` in command prompt
 2. Download template data from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4449634#.YAma5-hKhPY) to `template` subfolder
 3. Set `benchmark` parameter in config.json to `true` and `type` to `ERP` or `OSCIL` depending on the signal type you want to analyze
 4. Run the main script **validation_framework.m** (it is a very long process... Don't worry)
 5. Run your own source reconstruction pipeline on the newly generated pseudo-EEG stored in pseudo_eeg folder (one mat file by session). Please, use the template atlas to compute the final region-by-region signal.
 6. Save the n_sessions x 1 structure with fields `signal`and `label` corresponding to the reconstructed sources and set the corresponding path in config.json as `reconstr_source` parameter (ensure label order is the same than atlas labels)
 7. Set `evaluation` parameter to `true` and run again the main script. The benchmark score appears in the second figure. 
 
## Custom analysis
1. Clone this github repository : `git clone https://github.com/LucaLaFisca/Validation-Framework-Source-Reconstruction.git` in command prompt
2. Set the configuration parameters with respect to their definition (see below) and **set `benchmark` and `evaluation` parameters to `false`**
3. Run the main script **validation_framework.m** (it is a very long process... Don't worry)
4. Run your own source reconstruction pipeline on the newly generated pseudo-EEG stored in pseudo_eeg folder (one mat file by session). Please, use the atlas defined in the config to compute the final region-by-region signal.
5. Save the n_sessions x 1 structure with fields `signal`and `label` corresponding to the reconstructed sources and set the corresponding path in config.json as `reconstr_source` parameter (ensure label order is the same than atlas labels)
6. Set `evaluation` parameter to `true` and run again the main script. The final score appears in the second figure.
